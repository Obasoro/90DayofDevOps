## Resources

I am always open to adding additional resources to these readme files as it is here as a learning tool.

My advice is to watch all of the below and hopefully you have also picked something up from the text and explanations above.

- [DevOps in 5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrgk023l4lI)
- [What is DevOps? Easy Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gpe1Zn-1fE&t=43s)
- [DevOps roadmap 2022 | Success Roadmap 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l_n97Mt0ko)
